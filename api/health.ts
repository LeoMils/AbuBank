/*
 * AbuBank /api/health — platform health endpoint (P0).
 *
 * Returns whether the deployed runtime is actually wired:
 *   • Which server-side env vars are present (NAMES ONLY — never values).
 *   • Which API routes are configured (existence is implicit; we list
 *     them for the client diagnostic panel).
 *   • Server time + build version, so the client can detect a stale
 *     PWA bundle.
 *
 * Truth Contract:
 *   • Never returns a secret value. Only "present" | "missing".
 *   • `ok` is true ONLY when every required env var is present.
 *
 * This is a public diagnostic endpoint. It exposes ONLY presence
 * booleans plus the public build identity — nothing sensitive.

const BUILD_LABEL = 'AbuBank 0.283.0 — GOLDEN-SESSION. ONLINE REBUILT (device: every query returned garbage). The JUDGE now gates EVERY spoken answer — a raw provider snippet is NEVER spoken; on a miss it REFINES with a fresh search, then judges the snippets, else an honest miss. TIME is deterministic (Asia/Jerusalem), never web-searched (it had returned the Ashburn datacenter clock). News is synthesized, not category names. diag.answerPath proves which path answered from the deployed endpoint. NAME fixed: her own name failed on ט/ת homophones — folded, so she ALWAYS resolves and is never told she does not exist. RELATIONSHIPS: the relation BETWEEN two people as one natural possessive phrase (Yael is the partner of Leo sister), never routed through Martita, never the בני משפחה non-answer. BARGE-IN: local playback is now MUTED synchronously on user speech (a server cancel never stopped the buffered audio — why she did not stop). FORCED-RESPONSE + REPETITION: the tool-result watchdog re-arms on progress so it no longer fires during a slow two-response/online answer and force-DUPLICATES it (that was the 7x forced-response and the same-sentence-3x). Do NOT merge (production serves Aug 5).'
