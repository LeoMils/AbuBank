/*
 * AbuBank /api/health — platform health endpoint (P0).
 *
 * Returns whether the deployed runtime is actually wired:
 *   • Which server-side env vars are present (NAMES ONLY — never values).
 *   • Which API routes are configured (existence is implicit; we list
 *     them for the client diagnostic panel).
 *   • Server time + build version, so the client can detect a stale
 *     PWA bundle.
 *
 * Truth Contract:
 *   • Never returns a secret value. Only "present" | "missing".
 *   • `ok` is true ONLY when every required env var is present.
 *
 * This is a public diagnostic endpoint. It exposes ONLY presence
 * booleans plus the public build identity — nothing sensitive.

const BUILD_LABEL = 'AbuBank 0.241.0 — PERSISTENT MEMORY on the live path (convergence v3, queue #1). In the trace Abu repeatedly told Martita she cannot update anything (a death, a new family member) — because the realtime path had NO memory tool, even though the durable saved-memory store already existed for the typed path. Fix: registered ONE live tool remember (one dispatch line in liveTools.ts) that durably saves a fact via the existing savedMemory store (IndexedDB + localStorage, privacy-enforced), and injects saved facts into every session so they are known next time. The permitted-speech line FORBIDS ever saying she cannot update. Sensitive facts (phone/medical/financial/street) are declined gently at the write boundary. MEASURED on the real gpt-realtime instrument: a death update now calls the remember tool and Abu says she will remember (no more I-cannot-update); a new-family-member update saves + confirms. Tests persistentMemoryLive (7, incl cross-session injection + sensitive-declined) + mutant live-memory-not-persisted KILLED. Prior: no-harm guard (v0.240).'
