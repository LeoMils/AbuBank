/*
 * AbuBank /api/health — platform health endpoint (P0).
 *
 * Returns whether the deployed runtime is actually wired:
 *   • Which server-side env vars are present (NAMES ONLY — never values).
 *   • Which API routes are configured (existence is implicit; we list
 *     them for the client diagnostic panel).
 *   • Server time + build version, so the client can detect a stale
 *     PWA bundle.
 *
 * Truth Contract:
 *   • Never returns a secret value. Only "present" | "missing".
 *   • `ok` is true ONLY when every required env var is present.
 *
 * This is a public diagnostic endpoint. It exposes ONLY presence
 * booleans plus the public build identity — nothing sensitive.

The 0.164.0 durable fix did NOT hold on the physical iPhone: after import → full close → reopen, names + photos remained but ALL phone numbers were gone again (the number-less default seed shape). Rather than guess another storage-policy change, this build adds a PRIVACY-SAFE startup trace (counts only — never a name or number) that records at each boot stage: boot-start localStorage contact/phone count; reconcile localStorage-vs-IndexedDB counts + which copy WON; store phone count post-init; store phone count post-seed/migrate; and the phone count when Abu WhatsApp actually reads the contacts. The trace persists across the failed reopen (localStorage + best-effort IndexedDB mirror, keyed outside the durable reconcile set) and is rendered as a copyable, read-only textbox in Operator Settings → Contact Management (testid persistence-trace) with Copy/Refresh/Clear. durableStore exposes a one-way reconcile observer (no import cycle). NO reconciliation policy was changed in this build — it is instrumentation to locate the true first divergence. Evidence: CODE + TEST. DEVICE: awaiting the operator-captured trace after a reopen. Builds on 0.164.0.'
