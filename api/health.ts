/*
 * AbuBank /api/health — platform health endpoint (P0).
 *
 * Returns whether the deployed runtime is actually wired:
 *   • Which server-side env vars are present (NAMES ONLY — never values).
 *   • Which API routes are configured (existence is implicit; we list
 *     them for the client diagnostic panel).
 *   • Server time + build version, so the client can detect a stale
 *     PWA bundle.
 *
 * Truth Contract:
 *   • Never returns a secret value. Only "present" | "missing".
 *   • `ok` is true ONLY when every required env var is present.
 *
 * This is a public diagnostic endpoint. It exposes ONLY presence
 * booleans plus the public build identity — nothing sensitive.

FIX CLASSES not instances (CLASS_AUDIT.md): whoIs no longer speaks a raw relationship hop chain (class C); the one dark flag without a promotion criterion, classified-monitor, now has one and is machine-enforced (class B); family answers may be WARM and add one true known detail, still grounded (class F). GOLDEN-SESSION 18/18. Companion score now runs BESIDE it: heuristic 100/100, gpt-4o-mini judge 90/100 (golden correctness 18/18) — she reads as a warm friend, not an assistant. REACHABILITY_LIST.md lets the owner confirm contacts in one pass; flagged a data gap (Dora/Jacobo appear living). Only outstanding = the four EAR items on the phone.
